# ADFDEVOPS
Hands-on lab about CICD for Azure Data Factory. Download files to C:\ADFDEVOPS and start by \labs\01 - Overview.

Drop me a note at rdaudt@yahoo.com if you need help with the labs or if you have any comment about it. 
I am always looking for opportunities to improve these labs.

Thanks and have fun!
